# pyGame Tour
Still WIP

## What does this repo do?
This repo consists of two scripts that utilize the pygame library. The first, **ded-men-hanging**, is a simple hangman game and is based on Tech with Tim's tutorial, but slightly modified. I just wanted to try out the pygame library to see what can be created. The second, **snek**, is similar to your typical snake game, but modified to be slightly harder and annoying. It is still a WIP as I plan to implement an AI to play snake through reinforcement training and hopefully another mode which allows the user to play it via gestures. 


## How do I run it?
